                  Once we complete a project, the relationship we have with our
                  client is far from over. We stand by our work, guaranteeing
                  craftsmanship for 3 years - triple the remodeling industry
                  standard. While our dedicated project managers are on site
                  everyday, the MRC office is also fully staffed to ensure that
                  communication lines remain open beyond the job site. We are
